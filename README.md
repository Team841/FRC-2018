# FRC-2018
2018 robot code
This repository contains all of Team 841's code for the 2018 robot - Athena
It is kind of messy - auto code hidden in the drivetrain subsystem, that kind of stuff. 
Fortunately most of the constants are stored in a single file! That's a start :^)

This code is created with the Eclipse IDE, and the WPILib RobotBuilder plugins/tools. 
Next  year we will start a new repository, for a new codebase using VSCode tool chain currently under development by WPILib contributors.

Maybe we can implement an enduring "muon" core function library, similar to 1678's structure?
